# Introduction to Node.js
# Getting started
Welcome to this *Introduction to Node.js* course. Before we begin you need to install and familiarize yourself with the tools we’re are going to use throughout this course.
##Install tools

###Node.js <img src="https://microservicebus.blob.core.windows.net/sample/nodejs-256.png" alt="Node.js"/>
Browse to https://nodejs.org and download and install the latest version of Node.js. Once installed, you should be able to run Node by opening a command prompt/terminal and type **“node”**. You are now in node, and can start typing JavaScript! Try typing **“console.log('Hello from Node.js')”** to verify it works. You can exit by closing the terminal or by hitting **CTRL+C**.

###Visual Studio Code <img src="https://microservicebus.blob.core.windows.net/sample/svcode.png" alt="VS Code"/>

Proceed by installing Visual Studio Code, which you can download from https://code.visualstudio.com/download. 
After completed, familiarize yourself with some of the [basics](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics).

###Chrome and Postman <img src="https://microservicebus.blob.core.windows.net/sample/postman.png" alt="Postman"/>

In some of the labs, we’re going to build Web API’s, and **Postman** is an excellent tool to use for testing those services. Postman is a Chrome extension and can be installed by opening Chrome and navigate to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en-US.

###MongoDB <img src="https://microservicebus.blob.core.windows.net/sample/mongo.png" alt="Postman"/>

MongoDB is one of the most commonly used databases for Node.js and in some of the labs we're going to use it. Download the community edition from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs&_ga=1.150965301.2000935923.1474745557#community]). Install it with complete opiton if asked.
